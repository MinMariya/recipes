Ingredients

    4 thin slices sourdough bread
    2 small ripe avocados, seeded, peeled, and cut up
    1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
    1 large tomato, sliced
    4 slices reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese*
    1 - 2 tablespoons red or green jalapeno jelly
    1 - 2 teaspoons lime juice
    2 cups arugula

Directions
1. 
Preheat broiler. Place bread slices on the unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil about 5 inches 
from the heat about 2 minutes or until bread is lightly toasted, turning once halfway through broiling. 
Remove from broiler.
2. 
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine avocados and cumin. Coarsely mash with a fork or potato masher 
(mixture should still be chunky). Spread avocado mixture on toasted bread slices. Top with tomato 
and cheese slices; set aside.
3. 
In a medium microwave-safe bowl microwave jelly on 100 percent power (high) for 20 to 30 seconds or 
until melted and slightly bubbly. Stir in lime juice; cool. Add arugula to jelly mixture; toss to coat.
4. 
Return sandwiches to broiler. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes more or until cheese is melted. To serve, top 
sandwiches with arugula mixture.
